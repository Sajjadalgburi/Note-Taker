## Description

During this particular week, I took on the task of enhancing a pre-existing front-end codebase. This project centered around a straightforward note-taking application designed to help users organize their thoughts and tasks during busy periods. My primary focus was on integrating logic into the frontend and initiating a server using Express.js.

One of the key objectives was to establish routes for both the homepage and the '/notes' endpoint. However, the central challenge lay in managing user input effectively and persisting it in a database file (db.json). This involved processes such as writing, saving, updating, and loading data from the database onto the website.

Working with Express.js in the backend was an enjoyable challenge for me, as it allowed me to expand my skills and overcome obstacles. However, I encountered some difficulties, particularly concerning manipulating the database file. Whether it was updating existing notes, writing new ones, or uploading the entire database, I faced hurdles that required careful handling.

Overall, this experience provided valuable insights into backend development and database management, pushing me to refine my skills further while delivering a functional and efficient note-taking application.
